## Features

### Live Settings Editor
Edit "Variable" settings in real-time without restarting the game. Change things like:
- Bloom intensity and light colors
- Weather and time of day (snow in summer!)
- Shadow distances and quality
- Sunlight brightness
- And much more - organized by category with search
- **Note:** Some settings may have unexpected effects. None are likely/able to corrupt your game, and all are temporary (since I removed the Options heading ones). If you find anything that seems wrong/doesn't work how you think it does, send me a message!

Some package mods sometimes tweak some of these, so this can also be a way of doing things like lighting mods more easily.

### Config Editor
View and edit Config values from GraphicsRules.sgr. This shows what's actually loaded in memory (not just what's in the file which can sometimes be wrong/changed after init) and includes hidden settings that don't appear in the original files. Much clearer and easier than editing the .sgr file manually IMO.

### Performance Patches
Collection of ASM patches for performance improvements. **Most are Steam (ts3w.exe) only** - EA users can still use all other features, but incompatible patches are greyed out.... One day I'll port some over I promise...

⭐'s for ones that I think are particuarly worthwhile

**Available Patches:**
- **Smooth Patch Dupe** - Like smooth patch but more focused, sets the frame limit (seconds per frame) more directly, same result but clearer intent and doesn't touch unrelated functions (All versions)
- **CPU Thread Optimization** - Optimizes thread placement for modern CPUs with P/E-cores or multiple CCXs (All versions)
- **Intersection Optimization** - SIMD optimization for navmesh calculations (Steam)
- **Timer & Thread Optimizations ⭐** - Increases timer resolution, optimizes critical sections, patches spin loops. Should be a significant improvement on CPU usage (Steam)
- **CreateFileW Random Access** - Improves file I/O performance by hinting random access patterns (Steam)
- **Map View Lot Streaming Blocker ⭐** - Prevents lot streaming while in map view, makes going in and out of map a lot less stuttery (Steam)
- **Optimized Lot Streaming ⭐⭐** - Disables camera-based lot loading (I think), enables throttling, sets camera speed threshold lower so lots load in when you stop moving more smoothly, major improvement (Steam). This is doable by setting the relevant settings in the streaming category for EA users, minus the camera tweak

There's also a lot of helper functions and easy to use things if you'd like to make your own, see **[patches/README.md](patches/README.md)** for technical details on how to write your own.

### Quality of Life
- **Memory Monitor**: Get warned when approaching the 4GB limit (Error 12) so you can save before you crash and lose it all
- **Custom UI keybind**: Change the toggle key (default: Insert)
- **Preset system**: Save/load/share your configurations.

## Installation

1. Install an ASI loader:
   - [dxwrapper](https://github.com/elishacloud/dxwrapper) or
   - [Smooth Patch](https://modthesims.info/d/658759/smooth-patch-2-1.html) (includes one, currently busted for EA I think?)

2. Drop `Sims3SettingsSetter.asi` into `The Sims 3\Game\Bin`

3. Launch the game

## Usage

**Press Insert** to open the UI (change this in Other/QoL tab)
**File → Save** to persist changes. Some patches require a restart (CPU Thread, CreateFileW)
Green text = modified and saved value, yellow text is modified but not saved.

### Settings Tab
- Only becomes available after loading into a game
- Right-click any setting to:
  - Edit beyond min/max bounds
  - Reset to default
  - Clear override (remove from ini)
  - Copy address for if you're REing

### Patches Tab
- Toggle patches on/off
- Incompatible patches are greyed out (EA sorry)
- Hover for descriptions and technical details
- Experimental patches marked with [EXPERIMENTAL] may be unsafe, more of a pre-release thing

### Config Values Tab
- Edit any Config heading value
- Right-click to clear override

### Presets
File → Presets to save or load configurations
- **Merge**: Apply preset on top of current settings
- **Overwrite**: Clear everything, apply only preset values

## Troubleshooting

**UI doesn't open?**
- Check for `S3SS_LOG.txt` in your game directory - send it to me if it exists
- You can also try changing the keybind in the ini by modifying `UIToggleKey=45` (See for IDs: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes)
- If no log file, your ASI loader isn't working

**Settings tab stuck on "initializing"?**
- Wait until you're fully in-game (past loading screen)
- If it doesn't auto-initialize, use the manual initialize button.
- Send me your log.

**Crashes while using specific patches**
- Send me your log

## For Developers

This tool features a modular patch system that makes adding custom patches v easy. All patches auto-register and appear in the GUI, the system handles memory protection, change tracking, and restoration automatically, which makes reverse engineering and patching muuuch simpler.
See **[patches/README.md](patches/README.md)** for the full guide and breakdown


## Known Issues & Coming Soon
**Working on:**
- Folder-ization of the codebase... desparately needed but I've muscle memories where everything is...
- UI improvements
- More values outside of the debugUI ones, things like AA, etc.. There's no convenient hook point for those however so I'll have to manually do it... which kind of stinks.
- More patches, more. more. more. Main one is object throttling. Lots we can throttle easily (might do a custom throttling thing also), objects are kind of horrific, but a way to slow down loading of them or track/manage them would basically fix the game, no hyperbole
- More.
